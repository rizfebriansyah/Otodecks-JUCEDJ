# Otodecks-JUCEDJ
  The application, which was made with the JUCE API, supports two audio players running at once and offers filtering options for the audio. It has a library interface that allows you to load audio tracks.

I am in charge of expanding the application by including a unique deck control Component and a music library Component, then incorporating them into a brand-new GUI layout of my own design. The unique deck control component should feature original artwork that is integrated into the paint function and provide a way for me to control a deck in a fun way. A user should be able to manage their music library inside of the application using the music library component. It ought to be possible for them to browse the music collection and add songs to the decks. In order to persist between application loads, it should also be able to save its state in a data file.
